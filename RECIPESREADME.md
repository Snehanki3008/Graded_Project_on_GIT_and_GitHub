In this repository, we have five different branches which have added different kinds of recipes for the entire grated project on Git and GitHub. 
The files contained are as follows 
1) Ingredients required for the recipe
2) The procedure of the recipe
3) Baking time required for the recipe
4) Additional information by which we can elevate the basic recipe

We have also added Jpg images of all the recipes mentioned in the repository.
