In this repository, we have five branches that have added different recipes for the entire graded project on Git and GitHub. 
The files contained are as follows 
1) Ingredients required for the recipe
2) The procedure of the recipe
3) Baking time required for the recipe
4) Additional information by which we can elevate the basic recipe

We have also added JPG images of all the recipes mentioned in the repository.
