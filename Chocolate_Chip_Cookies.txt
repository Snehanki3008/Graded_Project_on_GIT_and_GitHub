Ingredients:

2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1 cup packed light-brown sugar
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
2 large eggs
2 cups semisweet and/or milk chocolate chips
Instructions:

1. Preheat the Oven:
Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.

2. Combine Dry Ingredients:
In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour and baking soda. Set aside.

3. Cream Butter and Sugars:
In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, light-brown sugar, and salt until the mixture is smooth and creamy, about 2-3 minutes.

4. Add Eggs and Vanilla:
Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.

5. Add Dry Ingredients:
Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Do not overmix.

6. Add Chocolate Chips:
Gently fold in the chocolate chips using a spatula or wooden spoon.

7. Drop Cookie Dough onto Baking Sheets:
Drop rounded tablespoons of cookie dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.

8. Bake:
Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges of the cookies are lightly golden but the centers are still soft. Keep in mind that the cookies will continue to cook a bit after removing them from the oven due to the residual heat.

9. Cool on Baking Sheets:
Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely.

10. Enjoy:
Once the cookies are completely cool, enjoy them with a glass of milk or your favorite beverage.

Feel free to customize these cookies by adding nuts, different types of chocolate chips, or other mix-ins like dried fruit if you prefer. Enjoy your homemade chocolate chip cookies!
