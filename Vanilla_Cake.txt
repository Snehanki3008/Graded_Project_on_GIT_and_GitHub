Vanilla Cake Recipe
Ingredients:

For the cake:

2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
1 cup unsalted butter, softened
2 cups granulated sugar
4 large eggs
2 tsp pure vanilla extract
1 cup whole milk
For the vanilla frosting:

1 cup unsalted butter, softened
4 cups powdered sugar
1/4 cup whole milk
2 tsp pure vanilla extract
Instructions:

1. Preheat the Oven:
Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.

2. Combine Dry Ingredients:
In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.

3. Cream Butter and Sugar:
In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This may take about 3-4 minutes.

4. Add Eggs and Vanilla:
Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.

5. Alternate Adding Dry Ingredients and Milk:
Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the milk, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined; do not overmix.

6. Divide Batter and Bake:
Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Smooth the tops with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

7. Cool the Cakes:
Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for about 10 minutes, then remove them from the pans and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

8. Make the Vanilla Frosting:
In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened butter until creamy. Gradually add the powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla extract, and beat until smooth and fluffy.

9. Frost the Cake:
Once the cakes are completely cool, spread a layer of frosting on top of one cake layer. Place the second cake layer on top and frost the top and sides of the entire cake.

10. Decorate (optional):
You can decorate the cake with sprinkles, berries, or any other toppings of your choice.
