Ingredients:

1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter
2 cups granulated sugar
4 large eggs
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup chopped hazelnuts (toasted, if desired)
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips or chunks
Instructions:

1. Preheat the Oven:
Preheat your oven to 350째F (175째C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking pan or line it with parchment paper for easy removal.

2. Melt the Butter:
In a microwave-safe bowl or using a double boiler, melt the butter until it's completely liquefied. Allow it to cool slightly.

3. Mix Sugar and Eggs:
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the granulated sugar and eggs until well combined.

4. Add Vanilla and Melted Butter:
Stir in the vanilla extract and the slightly cooled melted butter.

5. Combine Dry Ingredients:
In a separate bowl, sift together the all-purpose flour, cocoa powder, and salt. Gradually add this dry mixture to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.

6. Add Hazelnuts and Chocolate Chips:
Fold in the chopped hazelnuts and semisweet chocolate chips until evenly distributed throughout the batter.

7. Pour into Baking Pan:
Pour the brownie batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it evenly.

8. Bake:
Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick or cake tester inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs (not wet batter).

9. Cool and Cut:
Allow the brownies to cool in the pan on a wire rack. Once completely cool, cut them into squares or rectangles.

10. Enjoy:
Enjoy your hazelnut brownies with a glass of milk or a scoop of vanilla ice cream if desired.

You can also enhance the hazelnut flavor by toasting the hazelnuts before adding them to the batter. Simply spread them on a baking sheet and toast them in the oven at 350째F (175째C) for about 8-10 minutes until they become fragrant. Then, roughly chop and add them to the brownie batter. Enjoy your homemade hazelnut brownies!
