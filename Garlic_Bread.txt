Garlic bread is a delicious and simple side dish that pairs well with pasta, soups, salads, and more. Here's a classic garlic bread recipe for you:

Ingredients:

1 French baguette or Italian bread loaf
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened
4-6 cloves garlic, minced (adjust to your preference)
2 tablespoons fresh parsley, finely chopped (optional)
Salt to taste
Instructions:

1. Preheat the Oven:
Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).

2. Prepare the Bread:
Slice the French baguette or Italian bread loaf in half lengthwise, creating two long halves. You can also cut the bread into smaller slices or leave it whole, depending on your preference.

3. Make the Garlic Butter:
In a mixing bowl, combine the softened butter, minced garlic, and chopped parsley (if using). Mix until all the ingredients are well incorporated. You can adjust the amount of garlic to suit your taste; more garlic will result in a stronger flavor.

4. Spread the Garlic Butter:
Spread the garlic butter mixture evenly over the cut sides of the bread. Make sure to cover the bread surface generously.

5. Reassemble and Wrap:
Place the two halves of the bread back together, with the buttered sides facing each other. Wrap the bread in aluminum foil, leaving the top open for ventilation.

6. Bake:
Place the wrapped garlic bread in the preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes, or until the bread is heated through and the butter has melted and infused the bread with garlic flavor.

7. Broil (Optional):
If you want a crispy, golden top, you can open the foil and broil the garlic bread for an additional 2-3 minutes, keeping a close eye on it to prevent burning. This step is optional but adds a nice crunch to the top.

8. Serve:
Remove the garlic bread from the oven, and carefully open the foil. Slice the garlic bread into individual servings, and serve it hot.

Enjoy your homemade garlic bread as a side dish or appetizer. It's perfect for dipping into marinara sauce, olive oil, or as a complement to many dishes.
