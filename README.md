Git-Based Recipe Repository

In the age of digital communication and widespread access to information, people have a growing interest in discovering and sharing recipes from diverse culinary traditions. However, there is a need for a simple and efficient platform where individuals can collaboratively share their favorite recipes while benefiting from version control to maintain the quality and accuracy of these culinary treasures. Traditional recipe-sharing websites often lack the transparency and collaborative capabilities that Git and GitHub offer, making it challenging to track changes, collaborate effectively, and maintain a structured repository of recipes.
